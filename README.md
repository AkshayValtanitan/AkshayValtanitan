I'm a 3rd-year college student and beginner developer, specializing in full-stack web development and game development using Java and Unity. Based in the Philippines, I worked on TaskIT, a web application that helps students efficiently manage assignments and deadlines. In this project, I combined Django, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Supabase to create responsive, user-friendly, and scalable solutions that enhance student productivity, time management, and academic organization.

I am passionate about growing as a developer and aspire to create games inspired by Philippine myths and another adventure game influenced by Terraria, combining creativity with technical skills to bring engaging digital experiences to life.
